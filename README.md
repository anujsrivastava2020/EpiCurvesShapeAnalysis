Statistical shape analysis of epidemic growth rate curves

The main file ClusterCurves.m reads in the epidemic data from an Excel File and generates a clustering 
of states according to the shapes of their growth rate curves. It produces several displays of clustered
rate curves. It also saves this state data so that it can be displayed as a labeled country map using the 
program DrawUSAMap.
